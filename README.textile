h1. Resque-Sharp

.NET implementation of Chris Wanstrath's "Resque":http://github.com/defunkt/resque, which is a Redis-based background processing framework.

h1. Why?

Some jobs need to be run on Windows using .NET code. Some need to run in pure Ruby on UNIX. Some need to run in Java/JRuby. Now we can do all of the above with one job processing framework.

h1. Contributing

This is just getting started and still bit of a mess. The VC# project needs to be cleaned up to point to relative paths for references, etc.  Contributions are very welcome. 

Once you've made your great commits:

1. "Fork" http://help.github.com/forking/ resque-sharp
