h1. Resque-Sharp

.NET C# implementation of Chris Wanstrath's "Resque":http://github.com/defunkt/resque, which is a Redis-based background processing framework.

h1. Why?

Some jobs need to be run on Windows using .NET code. Some need to run in pure Ruby on UNIX. Some need to run in Java/JRuby. Now we can do all of the above with one job processing framework.
